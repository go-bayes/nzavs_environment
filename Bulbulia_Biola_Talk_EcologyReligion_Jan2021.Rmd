## The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study

  - Planned 20-year longitudinal study, currently in its 11$^{th}$ year.
    
  - Postal questionnaire.
    
  - Sample frame drawn randomly from NZ Electoral Roll.
    
  - Large multidisciplinary research team.
    
  - Focus on personality, social attitudes, values, religion, adult character development, identity, employment, experiences of discrimination, well-being and health, and environmental attitudes ...
    
  - Current sample contains > 42,000 unique people, or 1.45% of the adult NZ population.
    
  - Here, we will draw on repsonses from *N* = 26,790 longitudinal participants who responded to two or more waves from 2009 -- 2018

## Histogram of Responses{data-background=NZAVSHISTOGRAM.png data-background-size=cover}


## We investigate

  1. Climate Beliefs
  
  2. Climate Concern
  
  3. Beliefs my behaviour can make a difference 
  
  4. Sacrificial Behaviour for the Environment 

## Model: within + between person dynamics {.footnotesize}

```{r, include =FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# for mod equation
d2<- dom %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(
    outcome = Env.ClimateChgReal,
    Rel_win = Relid_within,
    Rel_betw = Relid_betweenC
    )
eqa<- lmer(outcome ~ years *  Rel_betw +  Rel_win + (1 + Rel_betw|Id) +  (1 + Rel_win|Id), 
           data = d2)
```
```{r modelequation}
equatiomatic::extract_eq(eqa, wrap = TRUE, mean_separate	= TRUE ) 
```

<div class="notes">
We quantitatively consider: 

  1. *Between Person Differences*: "How do political and religious commitments predict ecological attitudes and behaviors"; 
  2. *Time Trends*: "How are these relationships changing overtime"
  3. *Within Person Differences*: "how does change within an individual in political and religious commitments affect ecological attitudes and behaviors?"
  4. *Comparative Dynamics*: "How do these trends within/between individuals differ for political and religious commitments

</div>

## Climate Beliefs

"Climate change is real."


## Climate change reality|  conservativism between: strong upward trend with large political divisions 


```{r cb1_p, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_p,
  terms = c( "yearsC","PoliticalConservativism_betweenC [minmax]"),
)) + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) # 
```

<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Over the past decade, there has been a strong trend for increasing climate reality beliefs.

- The gap between political conservatives and liberals is large, and constant (i.e. no interaction).

</div>

## Climate change reality| political conservativism within moves in the same direction 

```{r cb12, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_p,
  terms = c( "PoliticalConservativism_within [minmax]"),
)) + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) # 
```


<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Those who become more conservative are expected to become less believing of climate change over time.

- Those who become more liberal are expected to become more believing of climate change over time.

</div>


## Climate change reality| religious identification between trend shows nonlinear differentiation

```{r cb13, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_r,
  terms = c( "yearsC","Relid_betweenC [minmax]"),
))  + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) # 
```

<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Religious people are less accepting of climate change.

- Nonlinear change: the gap between highly identified religious people and secular people is  *growing*.

</div>




## Climate change reality| religious identification within moves against the between group trend

```{r cb14, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_r,
  terms = c( "Relid_within [minmax]"),
)) + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) 
```


<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Those who become more religious are expected to become slighly *more* believing of climate change over time.

</div>


## Climate change reality| religious identification 

```{r cb1T,cache = TRUE}
tab_model(cb1_r, show.r2 = FALSE )
```


<div class="notes">
Key points:

- The expected change *within* religious people is small, but steady, and it is tilting in the *opposite* direction to the between-individual trend. 

</div>

```

## Summary and Questions

-  Compared with a decade ago, New Zealanders are substantially (1) more aware (2) more concerned about climate change.

-  Sacrificial behaviours have been slow to follow this concern

-  Question: though less believing of and concerned about climate change, religious people think they can make a difference: **can we tap this potential?**

-  Question:  Any hypotheses for the why the within_religious trend differs from  the between_religious trend?

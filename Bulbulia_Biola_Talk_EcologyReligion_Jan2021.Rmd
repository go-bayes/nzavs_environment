## What is the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS)?

  - Planned 20-year longitudinal study, currently in its 11$^{th}$ year.
    
  - Postal questionnaire.
    
  - Sample frame drawn randomly from NZ Electoral Roll.
    
  - Large multidisciplinary research team.
    
  - Focus on personality, social attitudes, values, religion, adult character development, identity, employment, experiences of discrimination, well-being and health, and environmental attitudes ...
    
  - Current sample contains $>42,000$ unique people, or $1.45\%$ of the adult NZ population.
    
  - Here, we draw on  $N = 26,790$ longitudinal participants who responded to two or more waves from 2009 -- 2018

## Here, we investigate

  1. Climate Beliefs
  
  2. Climate Concern
  
  3. Beliefs my behaviour can make a difference 
  
  4. Sacrificial Behaviour for the Environment

```{r esT,cache = TRUE}
tab_model(es_r, show.r2 = FALSE)
```

## Summary and Questions

-  Compared with a decade ago, New Zealanders are substantially (1) more aware (2) more concerned about climate change.

-  Sacrificial behaviours have been slow to follow this concern

-  Question: though less believing of and concerned about climate change, religious people think they can make a difference: **can we tap this potential?**

-  Question:  Any hypotheses for the why the within_religious trend differs from  the between_religious trend?

## The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study {.build}

  - Planned 20-year longitudinal study, currently in its 12$^{th}$ year.
  
  - Sample frame drawn randomly from NZ Electoral Roll.

  - Postal questionnaire (coverage; retention ~ 80%)
    
  - Large multidisciplinary research team (40 +)
    
  - Focus on rpersonality, social attitudes, values, **religion**, **meaning-making**, **perfectionism**, **virtue**, employment, experiences of discrimination, physical and psychological health, and environmental attitudes ...
    
  - Current sample contains > 42,000 unique people, or 1.45% of the adult NZ population.
    
  - Here, we will draw on repsonses from *N* = 26,790 longitudinal participants who responded to two or more waves from 2009 -- 2018


## We investigate the following beliefs {.build}

  1. Climate beliefs: climate change: (a) is real (b) is human caused
  
  2. Climate concern
  
  3. Beliefs that my behaviour can protect the environment
  
  4. Sacrificial behaviour for the environment 

## Model: within + between person trends {.footnotesize}

```{r, include =FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# for mod equation
d2<- dom %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(
    outcome = Env.ClimateChgReal,
    Rel_win = Relid_within,
    Rel_betw = Relid_betweenC
    )
eqa<- lmer(outcome ~ years *  Rel_betw +  Rel_win + (1 + Rel_betw|Id) +  (1 + Rel_win|Id), 
           data = d2)
```
```{r modelequation}
equatiomatic::extract_eq(eqa, wrap = TRUE, mean_separate	= TRUE ) 
remotes::install_github("datalorax/equatiomatic")

```

<div class="notes">
We quantitatively consider: 

  1. *Between Person Differences*: "How do political and religious commitments predict ecological attitudes and behaviors"; 
  2. *Time Trends*: "How are these relationships changing overtime"
  3. *Within Person Differences*: "how does change within an individual in political and religious commitments affect ecological attitudes and behaviors?"
  4. *Comparative Dynamics*: "How do these trends within/between individuals differ for political and religious commitments

## Climate Beliefs

"Climate change is real."


## Climate change reality|  conservativism between: strong upward trend with large political divisions 


```{r cb1_p, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_p,
  terms = c( "yearsC [minmax]","PoliticalConservativism_betweenC [minmax]"),
)) + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) # 
```

<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Over the past decade, there has been a strong trend for increasing climate reality beliefs.
- The gap between political conservatives and liberals is large, and constant (i.e. no interaction).

</div>

## Climate change reality| political conservativism within moves in the same direction 

```{r cb12, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_p,
  terms = c( "PoliticalConservativism_within [minmax]"),
)) + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) # 
```


<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Those who become more conservative are expected to become less believing of climate change over time.
- Those who become more liberal are expected to become more believing of climate change over time.

</div>


## Climate change reality| religious identification between trend shows nonlinear differentiation

```{r cb13, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_r,
  terms = c( "yearsC [minmax]]","Relid_betweenC [minmax]"),
))  + scale_y_continuous(limits= (c(3,8))) # 
```

<div class="notes">
Key points:

- Religious people are less accepting of climate change.
- Nonlinear change: the gap between highly identified religious people and secular people is  *growing*.

</div>




## Climate change reality| religious identification within moves against the between group trend

```{r cb14, cache = TRUE}
plot(ggpredict(
  cb1_r,

```


<div class="notes">
Key point:
those who become more religious are expected to become slighly *more* believing of climate change over time.

</div>


## Climate change reality| religious identification 

```{r cb1T,cache = TRUE}
tab_model(cb1_r, show.r2 = FALSE )

Action: where the rubber (does not) meet the road and carbon is spared. Here, we're just looking at reported action, but there many other indicators to consider.

## Summary and Questions {.build}

-  Compared with a decade ago, New Zealanders are substantially (1) more aware (2) more believing of and concerned about climate change.

-  Sacrificial behaviour has been slow to follow this increasing concern.

-  Those who become more conservativism are expected to present relatively *diminished environmental beliefs, concerns, and behaviors*, whereas those who become less conservative are expected to present relatively *greater environmental beliefs, concerns, and behaviors*.

-  Those who become more religiously identified are expected to present relatively *greater environmental beliefs, concerns, and behaviors*, whereas those who become less religiously identified are expected to present relatively *diminished environmental beliefs, concerns, and behaviors* 

-  Beware of ecological fallacies! Between-person change is *not* the same as within-person change!

-  Question for my fellow IRPSIANS: what are hypotheses might explain why increasing religious identification predicts greater environmental awareness/behavior? 

## Histogram of Responses{data-background=NZAVSHISTOGRAM.png data-background-size=cover}
<div class="notes">
Substantial information in this dataset and many "natural experiments" -- the devastating Christchurch and Kaikoura earthquakes; the Christchurch mosque shootings; the COVID-19 lockdowns and recovery; several Rugby cup wins and losses; political changes ...  also many events within people -- birth, death, illness, recovery, retirement ...  We'd love to collaborate with you. Please get in touch.

<div class="notes">
The "Retake"

- identify a previously published study in the bio-cultural study of religion and engage it: reanalysis or novel data, novel methods, new conceptualization

- encouraged to collaborate with the authors of the previously published study

-	authors of the previously published study are encouraged to submit retakes of their previously published research

- invites special issue submissions in which curators will coordinate multiple analyses of the same dataset by separate teams -- what we call a “Many Takes” issue

- were there is internal disagreement among authors about the conceptualization, analysis, or interpretation of a study, we will allow multiple “takes” within the same submission

- our ordinary publication standards apply (inference not "p-values")
